OOP Concepts Used  
- Classes & Objects → `Habit`, `HabitTracker`, `Main`  
- Encapsulation → Habit details are private with getters & setters  
- Polymorphism→ (Future: Different habit types e.g., DailyHabit, WeeklyHabit)  
- Abstraction → User interacts only with high-level methods (`addHabit`, `markHabitCompleted`, etc.)  
- Inheritance (future extension)** → Can extend habit types
